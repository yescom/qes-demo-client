# Demo QES Client

This is a demo client for the yes signing
flow described [here](https://yes.com/docs/rp-devguide/1.2/QES/index.html).
To run the demo you have to put a client
certificate into the ``src/main/resources/certificate``
folder. An unsigned example document to be signed
can be found in the ``documents/`` folder.
